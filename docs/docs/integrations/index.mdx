# Integrations

Agent Runtimes provides a flexible agent architecture built on top of [Pydantic AI](https://ai.pydantic.dev).

## Why Pydantic AI?

We chose Pydantic AI as our foundation because it provides:

- **Type Safety** — Full type checking with Pydantic models for inputs and outputs
- **Structured Outputs** — Reliable JSON responses from LLMs with validation
- **Tool Calling** — First-class support for function tools and MCP toolsets
- **Multi-Model Support** — Works with Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Azure, and more
- **Production Ready** — Well-tested and actively maintained

## Creating an Agent

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from agent_runtimes.mcp import get_mcp_toolsets

# Get pre-loaded MCP toolsets
mcp_toolsets = get_mcp_toolsets()

# Create an agent with MCP tools
agent = Agent(
    "anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant with access to web search.",
    mcp_servers=mcp_toolsets,
)
```

## Model Providers

Agents can use models from multiple providers:

| Provider | Model Format |
|----------|-------------|
| Anthropic | `anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-20250514` |
| OpenAI | `openai:gpt-4o` |
| Azure OpenAI | `azure:gpt-4o` |
| AWS Bedrock | `bedrock:us.anthropic.claude-3-sonnet` |
| Google | `google:gemini-1.5-pro` |

## Per-Request Model Selection

Switch models dynamically without restarting:

```python
# Use Claude for complex reasoning
result = await agent.run("Analyze this data...", model="anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-20250514")

# Use GPT-4 for creative tasks
result = await agent.run("Write a poem...", model="openai:gpt-4o")
```

## Future Framework Support

:::note Community-Driven
We're open to expanding support for other agent frameworks based on community feedback:

- **Google ADK** — Google's Agent Development Kit
- **LangChain** — Popular Python agent framework
- **CrewAI** — Multi-agent orchestration
- **AutoGen** — Microsoft's agent framework

[Share your feedback](https://github.com/datalayer/agent-runtimes/discussions) on which frameworks you'd like to see supported!
