"""Conversation checkpointing for durable agents.

Provides application-level checkpoints — snapshots of the agent's
message history at key points so the agent (or user) can rewind
to any checkpoint if an approach fails.

Complementary to CRIU (container-level checkpoints) and DBOS
(transient failure durability). Conversation checkpoints handle
strategic failures — wrong approach, dead-end reasoning.
