**Agent Runtimes** is a unified library for deploying, managing, and interacting with AI agents across multiple protocols and frameworks. It provides both a Python server for hosting agents and React components for seamless integration into web and desktop applications.

## What is Agent Runtimes?

Agent Runtimes solves the complexity of deploying AI agents by providing:

1. **Protocol Abstraction**: One agent, multiple protocols - deploy your agent once and access it through ACP, Vercel AI SDK, AG-UI, MCP-UI, or A2A without changing your code.

2. **Framework Flexibility**: Write agents using your preferred framework (Pydantic AI, LangChain, Jupyter AI) while maintaining a consistent API.

3. **Cloud Runtime Management**: Built-in integration with Datalayer Cloud Runtimes for launching and managing compute resources with Zustand-based state management.

4. **UI Components**: Pre-built React components (ChatBase, ChatSidebar, ChatFloating) that connect to agents and execute tools directly in the browser.

5. **Tool Ecosystem**: Seamless integration with MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools, custom tools, and built-in utilities for Jupyter notebooks and Lexical documents.

- **LangChain**: Complex workflows (adapter ready)
- **Jupyter AI**: Notebook integration (adapter ready)

### Built-in Features
- 🔌 **Flexible Architecture**: Easy to add new agents and protocols
- 🛠️ **Tool Support**: MCP, custom tools, built-in utilities
- 📊 **Observability**: OpenTelemetry integration
- 💾 **Persistence**: DBOS support for durable execution
- 🔒 **Context Optimization**: LLM context management

## Examples

The examples will demonstrate how to use the Agent Runtimes functionality in various scenarios and frameworks.

```bash
make examples
```

On the main page, you’ll find an example gallery (cards) that break things down into practical building blocks:

• UX patterns (aka GenUI) with protocols like A2UI and AG-UI
• Interactive or triggered workflows
• Agent Identity and Controls with guardrails, monitoring, tool approvals
• Programmatic tooling with Sandbox and Codemode for MCP and Skills
• Outputs and Notifications
• Real-time collaboration with users, subagents, and multi-agent teams
• Custom agents built from Agentspecs
• ...

Each of these concerns deserves more than a one-off solution—they need deep, composable, and pluggable implementations.

## Documentation

The detailed guides for architecture, use cases, interactive chat, key concepts, and runtime configuration are now in Docusaurus docs:

- [Agent Runtimes Overview](https://agent-runtimes.datalayer.tech/)
- [Integrations](https://agent-runtimes.datalayer.tech/integrations)
- [Chat](https://agent-runtimes.datalayer.tech/chat)
- [Transports](https://agent-runtimes.datalayer.tech/transports)
- [Programmatic Tools](https://agent-runtimes.datalayer.tech/programmatic-tools)
- [CLI](https://agent-runtimes.datalayer.tech/cli)

## Agentspecs

Generated catalogs are produced via:

```bash
make specs
```

Generation scripts are under [scripts/codegen](https://github.com/datalayer/agent-runtimes/tree/main/scripts/codegen), and outputs are written to:

- Python: [agent_runtimes/specs](https://github.com/datalayer/agent-runtimes/tree/main/agent_runtimes/specs)
- TypeScript: [src/specs](https://github.com/datalayer/agent-runtimes/tree/main/src/specs)
