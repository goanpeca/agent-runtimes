# Programmatic Tools

## What this page covers

- Why we offer two capabilities: programmatic [Codemode](https://agent-codemode.datalayer.tech) and reusable [Skills](https://agent-skills.datalayer.tech/)
- How the toggles behave in the UI/backend
- When to use each mode, and when to combine them
- Configuration levers (`allow_direct_tool_calls`, reranker hook) and their tradeoffs

## Goals
- **Codemode:** let the agent write Python to compose tools directly, reducing LLM tool-call overhead and enabling control flow, parallelism, and error handling.
- **Skills:** package reusable workflows (instructions, resources, scripts) so an agent can load, read resources, and run scripts without writing new code each time.
- **Coexistence:** you can enable Skills, Codemode, or both. Codemode provides its own tool discovery/execution; Skills surface curated capabilities.

## Toggles and behavior
- **Enable Codemode**: adds `CodemodeToolset` (list/search tools, execute Python code). When Codemode is on, selected MCP servers are used to build Codemode’s registry (tools are exposed via Codemode meta-tools rather than direct MCP tools).
- **Enable Skills**: adds `AgentSkillsToolset` (skills discovery, load, resource read, script run). Uses the configured `skills/` directory.
- **Both on**: Skills remain available for loading/running scripts; Codemode is used for tool discovery and code execution.

## Codemode toolset capabilities
- `list_tool_names` (fast names-only, supports `server`, `keywords`, `limit`)
- `search_tools` (returns tool definitions; can be reranked, includes deferred tools by default)
- `get_tool_details` (full schema, output shape, and examples for one tool)
- `list_servers` (connected MCP servers)
- `execute_code` (Python in sandbox; import bindings from `generated.servers.<server>`)
- `call_tool` (single tool call) — **optional**, see below

## Direct tool calls: `allow_direct_tool_calls`
- When **false** (default in agent-runtimes codemode setup):
	- `call_tool` is hidden; all execution goes through `execute_code`.
	- Instructions emphasize code-first composition, mirroring the “write code to use tools” pattern.
- When **true** (opt-in):
	- `call_tool` is exposed as a convenience for single calls.
	- Useful for simple queries where code would be overkill.
- Choose **false** for stricter discipline and clearer audit of composed workflows; choose **true** for convenience at the cost of less enforced structure.

## Search quality: reranker hook
- `search_tools` accepts an optional async reranker: `tool_reranker(tools, query, server) -> list[ToolDefinition]`.
- Use it to reorder results (e.g., LLM-based relevance, business priority). Failures fall back to registry order.
- This keeps discovery flexible without tying Codemode to any specific model provider.

## Execution model
- Codemode runs **Python** in an isolated sandbox (code-sandboxes). Agents import tool bindings from `generated.servers.<server_name>`.
- Use `async/await`, loops, conditionals, and `asyncio.gather` for parallelism.
- Errors are caught and surfaced in the `execute_code` result payload, alongside `stdout`/`stderr`.

## Skills model
- Skills live in a `skills/` directory with `SKILL.md`, resources, and scripts.
- Tooling provided by `AgentSkillsToolset`: `list_skills`, `load_skill`, `read_skill_resource`, `run_skill_script`.
- Skills can be authored as files or programmatic callables; they complement Codemode when you want curated, reusable behaviors.

## UI & backend flow
- UI checkboxes toggle Skills/Codemode. If Codemode is enabled, MCP server selection is still available and is used to scope Codemode discovery.
- Backend route `/api/v1/agents` builds toolsets accordingly:
	- Skills enabled → add `AgentSkillsToolset`.
	- Codemode enabled → add `CodemodeToolset` with `allow_direct_tool_calls=False` by default.

## Skills-first, Codemode glue (example)
Use Skills for curated, reusable steps and Codemode for orchestration:

```python
# 1) Load skill instructions
load_skill("pdf-extractor")

# 2) Compose multi-step flow in code
execute_code(code='''
from generated.servers.filesystem import read_file
from skills.pdf_extractor import extract

doc = await read_file({"path": "/data/report.pdf"})
result = await extract(doc)
print(result)
''')
```

## Choosing a pattern
- **Use Skills** when you want repeatable, reviewed workflows and clearer governance.
- **Use Codemode** when you need ad-hoc composition, control flow, and efficiency.
- **Use both** when you want curated capabilities (Skills) plus the ability to glue them together with code (Codemode).

## Configuration summary
- `allow_direct_tool_calls`: hide or expose `call_tool` (defaults to false in agent-runtimes wiring).
- `tool_reranker`: optional async hook to reorder `search_tools` results.
- `keywords`/`limit` on `list_tool_names`: faster, filtered discovery.
- `include_deferred` on `search_tools`/`list_tool_names`: control discovery of tools marked `defer_loading`.
- `max_tool_calls`: optional per-run safety cap on tool invocations inside `execute_code`.

## `allow_direct_tool_calls`
- **What it does:** Controls whether the `call_tool` shortcut is exposed. When off, all tool usage flows through `execute_code`, which keeps execution auditable and code-first.
- **Default:** `false` in agent-runtimes wiring (CodemodeToolset is instantiated with direct calls disabled).
- **When to set true:** Simple, single-step calls where the overhead of writing code is unnecessary, or for rapid prototyping.
- **When to keep false:** Shared/production agents, where you want consistent logging, fewer accidental direct calls, and clearer control over how tools are composed.

## `tool_reranker`
- **What it does:** Optional async hook `tool_reranker(tools, query, server) -> list[ToolDefinition]` that reorders `search_tools` results.
- **Why use it:** Apply model-based relevance, business rules, or safety filters to discovery without changing the registry itself.
- **Behavior on error:** If the hook raises or fails, Codemode falls back to registry order; search still returns results.
- **Usage tip:** Log applied ordering when the hook is enabled to keep discovery transparent.

## Safety and clarity tips
- Prefer `allow_direct_tool_calls=False` in shared/production agents to keep a single, auditable execution path via `execute_code`.
- When enabling reranking, log or trace the applied order for transparency.
- Keep Skills concise and documented; use Codemode for bespoke multi-step tasks.

## Recommended defaults (cookbook)
**Production**
- `enable_skills`: true
- `enable_codemode`: true
- `allow_direct_tool_calls`: false
- `enable_tool_reranker`: true (if you have a safe reranker configured)
- `max_tool_calls`: set a conservative limit (e.g., 50–200) to prevent runaway loops

**Prototyping**
- `enable_skills`: optional
- `enable_codemode`: true
- `allow_direct_tool_calls`: true
- `enable_tool_reranker`: optional
- `max_tool_calls`: unset or higher limit for exploration
