# Agent Specs (agentspecs)

Agent Runtimes uses the [agentspecs](https://github.com/datalayer/agentspecs) repository
as the source of truth for:

- Agents
- MCP servers
- Skills
- Environment variables

These specs are cloned locally and then compiled into the runtime catalogs used by
Agent Runtimes.

## Clone and Generate

From the repository root:

```bash
make specs
```

This command:
- Clones the agentspecs repository into ./agentspecs (or pulls updates)
- Generates Python and TypeScript catalogs for agents, MCP servers, skills, and env vars

## Using a Local agentspecs Checkout

If you already have agentspecs checked out elsewhere, copy or symlink it to
./agentspecs before running make specs.

## Where Specs Are Used

The generated catalogs are written to:

- agent_runtimes/config/agents.py
- agent_runtimes/config/skills.py
- agent_runtimes/config/envvars.py
- agent_runtimes/mcp/catalog_mcp_servers.py
- src/config/agents.ts
- src/config/skills.ts
- src/config/envvars.ts
- src/config/mcpServers.ts
